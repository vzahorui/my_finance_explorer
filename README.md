This is a web-app built using Streamlit which allows keeping track of personal finances. The actual data is stored in a SQLite database.

The app is run as `streamlit run main.py`.

On the main page it is possible to either edit the balance sheet directly or run transactions which would perform incremental operations over the specified account Ids.
